However, JavaScript supports concurrent execution through asynchronous operations, leading to a paradigm that mimics multithreading. In this post, we&#39;ll uncover the intricacies of JavaScript concurrency and explore how asynchronous operations enable multithreaded-like behavior. Asynchronous operations are fundamental to JavaScript concurrency. They allow time-consuming tasks, such as I/O operations or network requests, to be executed asynchronously, freeing up the main thread to handle other tasks. Simulating Multithreading with Asynchronous Operations</p><h2 id="child-process" tabindex="-1">Child Process <a class="header-anchor" href="#child-process" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Child Process&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In Node.js, a child process is a separate instance of the Node.js runtime that runs alongside the parent process. These child processes can execute independently from the parent process, allowing for parallel execution of tasks . The &#39;spawn&#39; function is a part of the child_process module in Node.js, which provides a way to create new child processes. It allows you to execute external commands or run scripts in separate processes. The spawn function takes a command (such as the name of an executable) and an array of arguments as its parameters.</p><p>Spawn function implementation Child Process Running Concurrently</p><ol><li>We spawn a child process using spawn from the child_process module.
